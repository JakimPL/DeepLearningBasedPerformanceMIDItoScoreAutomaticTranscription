    abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.},

    abstract = {Music transcription is the process of transforming recorded sound of musical performances into symbolic representations such as sheet music or MIDI files. Extensive research and development have been carried out in the field of music transcription and technology. This comprehensive review paper surveys the diverse methodologies, techniques, and advancements that have shaped the landscape of music transcription. The paper outlines the significance of music transcription in preserving, analyzing, and disseminating musical compositions across various genres and cultures. It also provides a historical perspective by tracing the evolution of music transcription from traditional manual methods to modern automated approaches. It also highlights the challenges in transcription posed by complex singing techniques, variations in instrumentation, ambiguity in pitch, tempo changes, rhythm, and dynamics. The review also categorizes four different types of transcription techniques, frame-level, note-level, stream-level, and notation-level, discussing their strengths and limitations. It also encompasses the various research domains of music transcription from general melody extraction to vocal melody, note-level monophonic to polyphonic vocal transcription, single-instrument to multi-instrument transcription, and multi-pitch estimation. The survey further covers a broad spectrum of music transcription applications in music production and creation. It also reviews state-of-the-art open-source as well as commercial music transcription tools for pitch estimation, onset and offset detection, general melody detection, and vocal melody detection. In addition, it also encompasses the currently available python libraries that can be used for music transcription. Furthermore, the review highlights the various open-source benchmark datasets for different areas of music transcription. It also provides a wide range of references supporting the historical context, theoretical frameworks, and foundational concepts to help readers understand the background of music transcription and the context of our paper.},

    abstract = {Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is an important task in music information retrieval. Prior work has focused on multiple fundamental frequency estimation (multi-pitch detection), the conversion of an audio signal into a timefrequency representation such as a MIDI file. It is less common to annotate this output with musical features such as voicing information, metrical structure, and harmonic information, though these are important aspects of a complete transcription. Evaluation of these features is most often performed separately and independent of multi-pitch detection; however, these features are non-independent.We therefore introduce MV 2H, a quantitative, automatic, joint evaluation metric based on musicological principles, and show its effectiveness through the use of specific examples. The metric is modularised in such a way that it can still be used with partially performed annotation— for example, when the transcription process has been applied to some transduced format such as MIDI (which may itself be the result of multi-pitch detection). The code for the evaluation metric described here is available at https://www.github.com/apmcleod/MV2H.},
