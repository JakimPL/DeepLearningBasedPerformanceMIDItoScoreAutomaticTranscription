\section{Transformers}

[a brief description transformer, Attention is all you need, ChatGPT]

As the authors state at the end of the paper \cite{Liu2022}:

\begin{quote}Possible next steps include investigating more powerful model architectures such as the Transformer.\end{quote}

We analyzed various setups involving Transformer and attention mechanisms, preserving . 

The vanilla Transformer tur
We hypothesize that Transformer architecture could outperform the proposed network but in a data-abundant scenario, but the entire dataset is still too small and needs more data-efficient models.
