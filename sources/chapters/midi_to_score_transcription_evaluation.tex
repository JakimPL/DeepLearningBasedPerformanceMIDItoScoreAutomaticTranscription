\chapter{MIDI-to-Score Transcription Evaluation}

When predicting a score out of a performance MIDI, one needs to evaluate how faithful an output is to the original sheet.

A score evaluation is far from a trivial task, and there are many reasons behind that. Music notation is complex enough, contains a variety of different elements, and solely for that reason it is hard to propose a metric that fairly encompasses all different elements of a musical notation structure, and assigns a single value in a reasonable way.

There can be many mistakes during a

Notice that an error in determining the rhythm structure of a affects further onset

Notation is sometimes ambiguous

Conversely, sometimes, there are many ways to denote the same thing, and there are some equivalences in music notation [example \missing].
