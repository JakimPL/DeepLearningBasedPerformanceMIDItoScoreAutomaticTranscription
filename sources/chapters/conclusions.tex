\subsection{Robustness Analysis}

We were able to discover certain artifacts of the score generation models, especially when it comes to velocity contribution to hand part assignment. The time signature model is not fully robust to alterations that should not have affect the output.

Unfortunately, the proposed methods have drawbacks and are not fully justified. Current XAI methods do not work well with symbolic music data in general. Developing more tailored and adaptable XAI methods for musical applications could contribute to improved model interpretability. One of the challenge would be to find a reasonable (and interpretable) embedding of the pitch space that encodes musical features.
